## Hey! 👋

<p>Welcome to my Github! It's a bit of a mess but I'm working on it.<br>
  Feel free to let me know if you find anything interesting or want to point something out.</p>

<br>

<h2>⚡ Quick Bits 🌈</h2>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>I'm a self-taught software developer 👩‍💻. I'm a Salesforce Developer by profession with roots in web and mobile development.</li>
  <li>I am a <strong>gamer</strong> 👾 and love creating game-related products (mechanics, writing, academic research, development, streaming, etc).</li>
  <li>I have <strong>ADHD</strong> and many of my personal passion dev ideas revolve around solving accessibility with technology.</li>
  <li>I'm also <em>trying</em> to start conversations on the intersection of tech and ethics and its impact on social progress and everyday life. <em>It's not going very well.</em></li>
  <li>I'm obsessed with mechanical keyboards ⌨️ and am an all around tech gear head.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>🌱 What I'm Working On ⭐️</h2>
</br>
<ul>
  <li>A React based website for my health tech startup - <strong>Sentinellium</strong></li>
  <li>A <strong>personal web portfolio</strong> of sorts to showcase all my skills and products. <em>Eventually I want to offer simple web portfolios as a service for college kids.</em></li>
  <li>A <strong>guitar trainer app</strong>. It's essentially a memorization assistive app for learning the fretboard.</li>
  <li>Focus: a <strong>reading assistant</strong> for those with ADHD and Dsylexic symptoms.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>To be completely honest...</h2>

>Aside from learning how to learn, teaching myself development and adjacent skills with only free resources is hard. And so progress has been slow.
><strong>But I'm having so much fun.</strong> Falling more and more in love with the process everyday.
