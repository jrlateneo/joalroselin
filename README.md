## Hey! 👋

<p>Welcome to my Github! It's a bit of a mess but I'm working on it.<br>
  Feel free to let me know if you find anything interesting or want to point something out.</p>

<h2>⚡ Quick Bits 🌈</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I'm a self-taught software developer 👩‍💻. I'm currently trying to become a web developer and is **learning React**</li>
  <li>I am a **gamer** 👾 and love creating game-related products (mechanics, writing, academic research, development, streaming, etc).</li>
  <li>I'm **ADHD** and many of my personal passion dev ideas revolve around solving accessibility with technology.</li>
  <li>I'm also _trying_ to start conversations on the intersection of tech and ethics and its impact on social progress and everyday life. _It's not going very well._</li>
  <li>I'm obsessed with mechanical keyboards ⌨️ and an all around tech gear head.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🌱 What I'm Working On ⭐️</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A React based website for my health tech startup - **Sentinellium**</li>
  <li>A **personal web portfolio** of sorts to showcase all my skills and products. _Eventually I want to offer simple web portfolios as a service for college kids._</li>
  <li>A **guitar trainer app**. It's essentially a memorization assistive app for learning the fretboard.</li>
  <li>Focus: a **reading assistant** for those with ADHD and Dsylexic symptoms.</li>
</ul>

>Aside from learning how to learn, teaching myself development and adjacent skills with only free resources is hard. And so progress has been slow.
>**But I'm having so much fun.**
